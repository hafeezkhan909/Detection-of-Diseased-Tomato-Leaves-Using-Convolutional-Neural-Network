# Detection-of-Diseased-Tomato-Leaves-Using-Convulation-Neural-Network
Almost all trees and shrubs are susceptible to one or more leaf spot diseases. Subsequently, it is important to identify the diseased leaves as it can alter plant survival, reproduction, competitive ability, growth, and susceptibility to agriculture and the environment. For maintaining the quality and quantity of plants and crops, it's important to enhance techniques that will help overcome the problem and getting a warning prior to the spread and devastation of the crops. Hence, the detection of diseases in plants plays an important role in the field of agriculture.

The plant leaves are the most common features to reflect the plants and healthy agriculture modules. The basic crops and vegetables are identified as good healthy crops vegetation, whereas the diseases caused to the vegetables are reflected on the leaves. The symptoms of the diseased leaves have spots of the shot hole, yellowing, necrosis, wilting of leaves and brownish skin. The dataset has been obtained from the PlantVillage Dataset published by CrowdAI. In this project, convulational neural networks has been applied for the image processing and classification of the tomato leaves. The model was trained on the healthy and diseased leaves (supervised learning). You are more than welcome to take this repository as a reference point and add various types and classes of leaves for the implementation!
